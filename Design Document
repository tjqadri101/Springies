SpringiesInput will be a way for users to input information to the model. It will have two methods that return lists of 
objects that the game engine might be interested in:
	public List<Mass> getMasses()
	public List<Force> getForces()

XMLInput will be a subclass of SpringiesInput that allows input in the form of an XML file whereas KeyboardInput will 
be a subclass that allows the user to create the input on his/her own.
Mass will be a class representing a mass in the system. The most commonly used fields inherited from JGObject will be
	String name
	double x
	double y
	double xspeed
	double yspeed
	It will have additional instance variables:
	protected double mass

Force will be an abstract class representing anything that can modify the vx or vy of a Mass. It will have a single 
method that calculates the force on a given object: public Vector calculateForce(Mass)

Link will be a class that extends Force, representing any object that connects two masses.
Spring will be a class that extends Link, with the following suggested instance variables:
	Mass a, b
	Double restlength
	Double constant

The Muscle class will extend link and will have the following instance variables:
	Mass a, b
	Double restlength
	Double amplitude

The instance variables for Spring and Muscle are based on the identifiers for these classes in the XML files provided to
us in the assets folders.
WorldForce is an abstract class that represents any type of constant force that comes from the environment.
Gravity will be a class that extends Force with one instance variable: g. Its calculateForce(Mass) method will simply
multiply g by the Mass’s mass.
Viscosity will be a class that extends Force with instance variables that describe the viscosity of the fluid.
Main will be the class that contains the public static void main() method and initializes the world, physics engine, etc.
